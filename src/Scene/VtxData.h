// A vector of homogenous vertex attributes stored contiguously is called a vertex stream.
// we assume tightly-packed (Interleaved) vertex attribute streams

// LOD is an index buffer of reduced size that uses existing vertices and, therefore, can be
// used directly for rendering with the original vertex buffer.

// define a mesh as a collection of all vertex data streams and a collection of all index
// buffers â€“ one for each LOD. The length of all vertex data streams is the same and is called
// the "vertex count." Put simply, we always use 32-bit offsets for our data.

// All of the vertex data streams and LOD index buffers are packed into a single blob. This
// allows us to load data in a single fread() call or even use memory mapping to allow
// direct data access.
